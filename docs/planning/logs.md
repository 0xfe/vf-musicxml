- 2026-02-10: Local/MCP Playwright browser launches were blocked by host MachPort/session constraints in this execution context; headless test gates passed and visual baseline updates remain environment-dependent.
- 2026-02-10: Added milestone-linked demo pipeline with tracked MusicXML demos (`happy-birthday`, `jingle-bells`), static build/serve scripts (`npm run demos:build`, `npm run demos:serve`), integration coverage (`tests/integration/demos.test.ts`), and README/AGENTS usage instructions.
- 2026-02-10: Replaced hand-authored demos with canonical LilyPond web fixtures (`01c`, `71g`), added `demos/lilypond/manifest.json` plus generated `demos/site/lilypond-roadmap.html`, and updated plan/todo/docs to make full LilyPond demo parity an explicit M7 end goal.
- 2026-02-10: Started M7 planning formalization; added `docs/m7-comprehensiveness-quality-plan.md`, split M7 into tracks M7A-M7D (comprehensiveness, quality rubric, layered eval framework, VexFlow upstream/release hardening), and updated M7 gates/checklists in plan/todo/ai-state.
- 2026-02-10: Implemented M7A corpus baseline: added LilyPond collated-suite sync script (`npm run corpus:lilypond:sync`), generated canonical corpus manifest (`fixtures/corpus/lilypond-collated-v2.25.json` with 30 categories / 156 fixtures), expanded seeded demos to 8 canonical fixtures, and refactored demo build pipeline + integration tests to validate roadmap seed/corpus consistency.
- 2026-02-10: Promoted M7A first conformance tranche by importing 8 seeded LilyPond fixtures into `fixtures/conformance/lilypond/` as active expected-pass cases and verified the expanded conformance workflow/report path remains green.

- 2026-02-10: Revalidated browser visual gates after M7A breadth expansion using repo-local Playwright binaries (`PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=/Users/mo/git/musicxml/.playwright npm run test:visual -- --workers=4`), confirming all sentinel visual specs remain green.
- 2026-02-10: Added long-form stress fixture `realworld-music21-beethoven-op133-longform` to the real-world corpus/conformance set (now 8 active real-world fixtures; 176 active conformance fixtures total), increased conformance execution test timeout to 15s for expanded corpus runtime, and revalidated all headless + visual + demo-build gates.
- 2026-02-10: Reorganized planning artifacts under `/Users/mo/git/musicxml/docs/planning/`; split milestone docs into per-milestone files (`milestone-0.completed.md` .. `milestone-7D.md`), introduced `status.md` + `logs.md` ownership model, moved active/closed backlog into `todo.md` and `todo.completed.md`, and relocated feedback history to `/Users/mo/git/musicxml/docs/planning/feedback.md`.
- 2026-02-10: Completed M7A closeout by formalizing real-world complexity metadata (`complexity_level`, `part_count_hint`, `long_form`) with deterministic breadth gates, triaging `lilypond-23c-tuplet-display-nonstandard` as explicit malformed-source expected-fail policy, adding M7A conformance-threshold assertions (expected-pass `>=97%`, unexpected failures `<=1%`, LilyPond category floors `>=90%`), and promoting M7A status to completed in planning docs.
- 2026-02-10: Enforced milestone completion naming convention by renaming `docs/planning/milestone-7A.md` to `docs/planning/milestone-7A.completed.md`, updating all cross-doc references, and adding explicit completion-rename policy in `AGENTS.md` and `docs/planning/README.md`.
- 2026-02-11: Completed M7B by integrating deterministic quality rubric scoring (`Q1..Q7`) into conformance execution/reporting (`qualitySummary` + per-fixture quality payload), calibrating collision/layout proxies to avoid false catastrophic flags, and enforcing M7B gates (expected-pass weighted mean `>=4.2`, zero expected-pass catastrophic fixtures, zero expected-pass critical collisions) in `tests/conformance/execution.test.ts`; validated with `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run test:conformance`, `npm run test`, and `npm run test:conformance:report`.
- 2026-02-11: Completed M7C by adding layered evaluation infrastructure: split/gate configs (`fixtures/evaluation/splits.json`, `fixtures/evaluation/gates.json`), deterministic split scoring utilities (`src/testkit/evaluation.ts` + `tests/unit/evaluation.test.ts`), layered runner command (`npm run eval:run`) with evaluation report artifacts (`artifacts/evaluation/evaluation-report.{json,md}`), perceptual diff output support, and runbook/prompt-schema governance docs.

- 2026-02-11: Closed milestone naming updates for M7 tracks by renaming planning docs to completed variants (`milestone-7.completed.md`, `milestone-7C.completed.md`, `milestone-7D.completed.md`) and updating cross-references in status/index/README/ai-state.
- 2026-02-11: Revalidated M7C/M7D completion gates after planning/doc restructuring and latest status format updates; `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run test:unit`, `npm run test:integration`, `npm run test:conformance`, `npm run test`, `npm run vexflow:gaps:check`, `npm run vexflow:gaps:brief`, `npm run eval:run`, and `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=/Users/mo/git/musicxml/.playwright npm run test:visual -- --workers=4` all pass.
- 2026-02-11: Clarified LilyPond roadmap semantics after coverage confusion: split roadmap table into `Conformance Status` vs `Demo Status`, documented that `demos/lilypond/manifest.json` `categoryStatus` tracks demo seeding only, rebuilt demos, and revalidated integration tests.
- 2026-02-11: Expanded demo generation to cover every active LilyPond conformance fixture (156 case pages) plus selected complex real-world fixtures (6 pages), added expected-fail demo-page handling for malformed fixtures, and updated demo docs/index navigation to split featured seed demos vs full-suite coverage.
- 2026-02-11: Fixed two high-signal rendering defects with generalized renderer updates: switched measure formatting to stave-aware note-area layout (`Formatter.formatToStave`) to prevent barline bleed in `lilypond-01a-pitches-pitches`, and added automatic per-voice beam generation (`Beam.generateBeams`) to restore beaming in `realworld-music21-bach-bwv1-6`.
- 2026-02-11: Added reusable notation-geometry tooling (`src/testkit/notation-geometry.ts`) for beam presence and notehead/barline intrusion audits, integrated intrusion metrics into conformance quality scoring (`Q6`), and added dedicated regression tests (`tests/integration/render-quality-regressions.test.ts`, `tests/unit/notation-geometry.test.ts`).
- 2026-02-11: Expanded visual sentinel coverage definitions to include `lilypond-01a-pitches-pitches` and `realworld-music21-bach-bwv1-6`; local Playwright launch remains blocked in this sandbox by MachPort permission errors (`bootstrap_check_in ... Permission denied (1100)`), so visual assertions could not be rebaselined here.
- 2026-02-11: Added browser-free visual portability tooling: `src/testkit/headless-visual.ts`, `scripts/run-headless-visual-regression.mjs`, `scripts/inspect-score-headless.mjs`, and `npm run inspect:score` to support fast one-score SVG/PNG/geometry inspection without Playwright; updated AGENTS/README/tips/ai-state docs to make this the default rapid triage path on headless hosts.
- 2026-02-11: Opened Milestone 8 planning (`docs/planning/milestone-8.md`) for golden-driven visual quality execution: LilyPond reference image mapping, deterministic geometry/presence/justification rule expansion, headless golden diffing, and wave-based fixture remediation across the full demo/conformance set.
- 2026-02-11: Implemented M8A golden-reference sync pipeline (`scripts/sync-golden-references.mjs`, `npm run golden:sync`) with full active LilyPond fixture coverage (156 mappings), cached PNG artifacts under `fixtures/golden/lilypond-v2.24/`, and generated manifest metadata (`fixtures/golden/manifest.json`) including checksum fields and explicit `referenceKind` tags for v2.24 primary vs v2.25 fallback references.
- 2026-02-11: Implemented M8B first-quality remediation for `lilypond-01a-pitches-pitches` by adding generalized first-column width compensation in `src/vexflow/render.ts`, eliminating opening-measure note compression, and extending notation geometry tooling with deterministic measure-spacing summaries (`summarizeMeasureSpacingByBarlines`) plus updated regression coverage and `inspect:score` reporting.
- 2026-02-11: Opened Milestone 9 style-fidelity program (`docs/planning/milestone-9.md`) with source-linked engraving guidance (LilyPond docs, SMuFL engraving defaults, MOLA guidelines, Behind Bars preview), explicit style dimensions (`S1..S6`), proof-point fixtures, and burndown-based execution tracks parallel to M8.
- 2026-02-11: Rebaselined and revalidated headless visual output for `lilypond-01a-pitches-pitches` after spacing fixes (`npm run test:visual:headless:update -- --fixtures=lilypond-01a-pitches-pitches` and `npm run test:visual:headless -- --fixtures=lilypond-01a-pitches-pitches` both pass).
- 2026-02-11: Implemented M8C initial golden runner (`npm run test:golden`, `scripts/run-golden-comparison.mjs`) with direct fixture-to-reference comparisons, crop-aware excerpt support, blocking vs advisory fixture policy, and triage artifacts under `artifacts/golden-comparison/`.
- 2026-02-11: Added first real-world proof-point manifest (`fixtures/evaluation/golden-proofpoints.json`) and executed `realworld-music21-bach-bwv1-6-8bars` against `fixtures/images/bwv-1.6-8bars.png`; run currently fails as advisory (expected) and serves as baseline evidence for missing pagination/title/part-label parity.
- 2026-02-11: Opened Milestone 10 (`docs/planning/milestone-10.md`) to deliver first-class pagination API (paginated default, horizontal continuous fallback), system/page layout engine, and publishing metadata elements (title, instrument labels, page numbers) required for high-fidelity PDF/image comparisons.
