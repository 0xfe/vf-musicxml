## Progress Log (Append-Only)
- 2026-02-10: Initial strategy drafted with M0-M7 milestone structure and test-first approach.
- 2026-02-10: Integrated Review 1 feedback (`F-001` to `F-016`). Switched to single-package early architecture, added CSM sketch, split sync/async parse API, defined strict/lenient behavior, moved Playwright to M2, moved collision audits to M3, added timewise plan, added distribution/patch strategy details, and updated conformance metadata scaling strategy.
- 2026-02-10: Integrated Review 2 feedback (`F-017` to `F-024`). Removed encoding artifacts from CSM events, clarified chord modeling, added explicit `ticksPerQuarter`, added `EffectiveAttributes`/spanner/diagnostic type sketches, clarified `.mxl` implementation timing, and pinned Vitest as the M0 test runner.

- 2026-02-10: Added fixture-level conformance `parse_mode` support (`strict`/`lenient`) and notation strict-vs-lenient fixture pair (`notation-invalid-pitch-step-*`) to validate nuanced warning-vs-error expected behavior.
- 2026-02-10: Added Playwright visual snapshot assertions and generated baseline images for smoke + conformance sentinel suites via `npm run test:visual:update`.
- 2026-02-10: Completed M3 milestone and advanced next-step focus to M4 notation/direction implementation scope.
- 2026-02-10: Implemented M4 parser/model notation flow: direction dynamics/wedges, note slurs, and post-parse spanner linking for ties/slurs/wedges with strict-mode diagnostic escalation coverage.
- 2026-02-10: Implemented M4 renderer notation flow: articulation mapping, direction text placement, and tie/slur/wedge drawing; corrected VexFlow API integration (`Curve` options, `StaveHairpin` note keys/options) and stabilized render diagnostics.
- 2026-02-10: Expanded M4 tests: parser continuity assertions for tie/slur/wedge, note-mapper articulation unit tests, SVG structure assertions for notation baseline, conformance assertions for `notation-m4-baseline`, and visual sentinel coverage/snapshots for notation baseline.
- 2026-02-10: Completed M4 docs/state sync: updated README milestone/status, refreshed rendering/CSM/diagnostic docs, and added `docs/notation-support-matrix.md` plus `plan.md`/`todo.md`/`ai-state.md` milestone state updates.
- 2026-02-10: Started M5 renderer layout baseline by replacing single-part rendering with multi-part/multi-staff system layout, per-staff note routing, and connector drawing (`singleLeft`, `brace`, `bracket`).

- 2026-02-10: Added M6 conformance fixture (`advanced-m6-notation-baseline`) and expanded unit/integration/svg/conformance test coverage for advanced notation constructs.
- 2026-02-10: Added `docs/advanced-notation-policy.md` and refreshed notation/rendering/tips/README/AI state docs to reflect M6 support and fallback boundaries.
- 2026-02-10: Local/MCP Playwright browser launches were blocked by host MachPort/session constraints in this execution context; headless test gates passed and visual baseline updates remain environment-dependent.
- 2026-02-10: Added milestone-linked demo pipeline with tracked MusicXML demos (`happy-birthday`, `jingle-bells`), static build/serve scripts (`npm run demos:build`, `npm run demos:serve`), integration coverage (`tests/integration/demos.test.ts`), and README/AGENTS usage instructions.
- 2026-02-10: Replaced hand-authored demos with canonical LilyPond web fixtures (`01c`, `71g`), added `demos/lilypond/manifest.json` plus generated `demos/site/lilypond-roadmap.html`, and updated plan/todo/docs to make full LilyPond demo parity an explicit M7 end goal.
- 2026-02-10: Started M7 planning formalization; added `docs/m7-comprehensiveness-quality-plan.md`, split M7 into tracks M7A-M7D (comprehensiveness, quality rubric, layered eval framework, VexFlow upstream/release hardening), and updated M7 gates/checklists in plan/todo/ai-state.
- 2026-02-10: Implemented M7A corpus baseline: added LilyPond collated-suite sync script (`npm run corpus:lilypond:sync`), generated canonical corpus manifest (`fixtures/corpus/lilypond-collated-v2.25.json` with 30 categories / 156 fixtures), expanded seeded demos to 8 canonical fixtures, and refactored demo build pipeline + integration tests to validate roadmap seed/corpus consistency.
- 2026-02-10: Promoted M7A first conformance tranche by importing 8 seeded LilyPond fixtures into `fixtures/conformance/lilypond/` as active expected-pass cases and verified the expanded conformance workflow/report path remains green.
- 2026-02-10: Promoted M7A second conformance tranche by importing 21 additional LilyPond fixtures as active expected-pass cases, expanded conformance assertions for LilyPond category rollups, and kept full test + conformance report pipelines green.
- 2026-02-10: Added reusable `npm run corpus:lilypond:import` tooling to promote future LilyPond case batches into conformance fixtures from case IDs/source names with deterministic metadata generation.
- 2026-02-10: Fixed grace-note beaming regression (`B-002`) by guarding VexFlow `GraceNoteGroup.beamNotes()` and degrading to unbeamed grace notes with warning diagnostics; promoted `lilypond-24a-gracenotes` to active expected-pass coverage.
- 2026-02-10: Added `npm run conformance:lilypond:promote` bulk pipeline, imported all remaining LilyPond collated-suite fixtures, removed duplicate legacy seed IDs, and reached full corpus parity in conformance metadata (156/156 imported and active).
- 2026-02-10: Added representative real-world corpus manifest + importer (`npm run conformance:realworld:import`) and activated first 5 real-world fixtures (OpenScore Lieder + music21 corpus samples) with provenance/license metadata in conformance sidecars.
- 2026-02-10: Expanded M7A real-world coverage to 7 active fixtures by adding a lead-sheet sample (`realworld-music21-berlin-alexanders-ragtime`) and a large orchestral/choral excerpt (`realworld-music21-bach-bwv248-42-4`), added deterministic bucket-coverage integration gates (`tests/integration/realworld-corpus.test.ts`), and revalidated full test + conformance-report pipelines.
- 2026-02-10: Revalidated browser visual gates after M7A breadth expansion using repo-local Playwright binaries (`PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=/Users/mo/git/musicxml/.playwright npm run test:visual -- --workers=4`), confirming all sentinel visual specs remain green.
- 2026-02-10: Added long-form stress fixture `realworld-music21-beethoven-op133-longform` to the real-world corpus/conformance set (now 8 active real-world fixtures; 176 active conformance fixtures total), increased conformance execution test timeout to 15s for expanded corpus runtime, and revalidated all headless + visual + demo-build gates.
- 2026-02-10: Reorganized planning artifacts under `/Users/mo/git/musicxml/docs/planning/`; split milestone docs into per-milestone files (`milestone-0.completed.md` .. `milestone-7D.md`), introduced `status.md` + `logs.md` ownership model, moved active/closed backlog into `todo.md` and `todo.completed.md`, and relocated feedback history to `/Users/mo/git/musicxml/docs/planning/feedback.md`.
- 2026-02-10: Completed M7A closeout by formalizing real-world complexity metadata (`complexity_level`, `part_count_hint`, `long_form`) with deterministic breadth gates, triaging `lilypond-23c-tuplet-display-nonstandard` as explicit malformed-source expected-fail policy, adding M7A conformance-threshold assertions (expected-pass `>=97%`, unexpected failures `<=1%`, LilyPond category floors `>=90%`), and promoting M7A status to completed in planning docs.
- 2026-02-10: Enforced milestone completion naming convention by renaming `docs/planning/milestone-7A.md` to `docs/planning/milestone-7A.completed.md`, updating all cross-doc references, and adding explicit completion-rename policy in `AGENTS.md` and `docs/planning/README.md`.
- 2026-02-11: Completed M7B by integrating deterministic quality rubric scoring (`Q1..Q7`) into conformance execution/reporting (`qualitySummary` + per-fixture quality payload), calibrating collision/layout proxies to avoid false catastrophic flags, and enforcing M7B gates (expected-pass weighted mean `>=4.2`, zero expected-pass catastrophic fixtures, zero expected-pass critical collisions) in `tests/conformance/execution.test.ts`; validated with `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run test:conformance`, `npm run test`, and `npm run test:conformance:report`.
- 2026-02-11: Completed M7C by adding layered evaluation infrastructure: split/gate configs (`fixtures/evaluation/splits.json`, `fixtures/evaluation/gates.json`), deterministic split scoring utilities (`src/testkit/evaluation.ts` + `tests/unit/evaluation.test.ts`), layered runner command (`npm run eval:run`) with evaluation report artifacts (`artifacts/evaluation/evaluation-report.{json,md}`), perceptual diff output support, and runbook/prompt-schema governance docs.
- 2026-02-11: Completed M7D by adding VexFlow gap lifecycle tooling: registry (`fixtures/vexflow/gap-registry.json`), validator (`src/testkit/vexflow-gap-registry.ts`), enforcement tests (`tests/integration/vexflow-gap-registry.test.ts`), check/brief commands (`npm run vexflow:gaps:check`, `npm run vexflow:gaps:brief`), upstream brief artifacts, sync log, and release-hardening checklist.
- 2026-02-11: Closed milestone naming updates for M7 tracks by renaming planning docs to completed variants (`milestone-7.completed.md`, `milestone-7C.completed.md`, `milestone-7D.completed.md`) and updating cross-references in status/index/README/ai-state.
- 2026-02-11: Revalidated M7C/M7D completion gates after planning/doc restructuring and latest status format updates; `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run test:unit`, `npm run test:integration`, `npm run test:conformance`, `npm run test`, `npm run vexflow:gaps:check`, `npm run vexflow:gaps:brief`, `npm run eval:run`, and `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=/Users/mo/git/musicxml/.playwright npm run test:visual -- --workers=4` all pass.
- 2026-02-11: Clarified LilyPond roadmap semantics after coverage confusion: split roadmap table into `Conformance Status` vs `Demo Status`, documented that `demos/lilypond/manifest.json` `categoryStatus` tracks demo seeding only, rebuilt demos, and revalidated integration tests.
- 2026-02-11: Expanded demo generation to cover every active LilyPond conformance fixture (156 case pages) plus selected complex real-world fixtures (6 pages), added expected-fail demo-page handling for malformed fixtures, and updated demo docs/index navigation to split featured seed demos vs full-suite coverage.
- 2026-02-11: Fixed two high-signal rendering defects with generalized renderer updates: switched measure formatting to stave-aware note-area layout (`Formatter.formatToStave`) to prevent barline bleed in `lilypond-01a-pitches-pitches`, and added automatic per-voice beam generation (`Beam.generateBeams`) to restore beaming in `realworld-music21-bach-bwv1-6`.
- 2026-02-11: Added reusable notation-geometry tooling (`src/testkit/notation-geometry.ts`) for beam presence and notehead/barline intrusion audits, integrated intrusion metrics into conformance quality scoring (`Q6`), and added dedicated regression tests (`tests/integration/render-quality-regressions.test.ts`, `tests/unit/notation-geometry.test.ts`).
- 2026-02-11: Expanded visual sentinel coverage definitions to include `lilypond-01a-pitches-pitches` and `realworld-music21-bach-bwv1-6`; local Playwright launch remains blocked in this sandbox by MachPort permission errors (`bootstrap_check_in ... Permission denied (1100)`), so visual assertions could not be rebaselined here.
- 2026-02-11: Added browser-free visual portability tooling: `src/testkit/headless-visual.ts`, `scripts/run-headless-visual-regression.mjs`, `scripts/inspect-score-headless.mjs`, and `npm run inspect:score` to support fast one-score SVG/PNG/geometry inspection without Playwright; updated AGENTS/README/tips/ai-state docs to make this the default rapid triage path on headless hosts.
- 2026-02-11: Opened Milestone 8 planning (`docs/planning/milestone-8.md`) for golden-driven visual quality execution: LilyPond reference image mapping, deterministic geometry/presence/justification rule expansion, headless golden diffing, and wave-based fixture remediation across the full demo/conformance set.
- 2026-02-11: Implemented M8A golden-reference sync pipeline (`scripts/sync-golden-references.mjs`, `npm run golden:sync`) with full active LilyPond fixture coverage (156 mappings), cached PNG artifacts under `fixtures/golden/lilypond-v2.24/`, and generated manifest metadata (`fixtures/golden/manifest.json`) including checksum fields and explicit `referenceKind` tags for v2.24 primary vs v2.25 fallback references.
- 2026-02-11: Implemented M8B first-quality remediation for `lilypond-01a-pitches-pitches` by adding generalized first-column width compensation in `src/vexflow/render.ts`, eliminating opening-measure note compression, and extending notation geometry tooling with deterministic measure-spacing summaries (`summarizeMeasureSpacingByBarlines`) plus updated regression coverage and `inspect:score` reporting.
- 2026-02-11: Opened Milestone 9 style-fidelity program (`docs/planning/milestone-9.md`) with source-linked engraving guidance (LilyPond docs, SMuFL engraving defaults, MOLA guidelines, Behind Bars preview), explicit style dimensions (`S1..S6`), proof-point fixtures, and burndown-based execution tracks parallel to M8.
- 2026-02-11: Rebaselined and revalidated headless visual output for `lilypond-01a-pitches-pitches` after spacing fixes (`npm run test:visual:headless:update -- --fixtures=lilypond-01a-pitches-pitches` and `npm run test:visual:headless -- --fixtures=lilypond-01a-pitches-pitches` both pass).
- 2026-02-11: Implemented M8C initial golden runner (`npm run test:golden`, `scripts/run-golden-comparison.mjs`) with direct fixture-to-reference comparisons, crop-aware excerpt support, blocking vs advisory fixture policy, and triage artifacts under `artifacts/golden-comparison/`.
- 2026-02-11: Added first real-world proof-point manifest (`fixtures/evaluation/golden-proofpoints.json`) and executed `realworld-music21-bach-bwv1-6-8bars` against `fixtures/images/bwv-1.6-8bars.png`; run currently fails as advisory (expected) and serves as baseline evidence for missing pagination/title/part-label parity.
- 2026-02-11: Opened Milestone 10 (`docs/planning/milestone-10.md`) to deliver first-class pagination API (paginated default, horizontal continuous fallback), system/page layout engine, and publishing metadata elements (title, instrument labels, page numbers) required for high-fidelity PDF/image comparisons.
- 2026-02-11: Continued M10 execution by hardening page output determinism: injected explicit SVG page background rects (`mx-page-background`) to remove transparent/black screenshot artifacts, added integration assertions for page-background presence, and revalidated renderer quality regression suites.
- 2026-02-11: Re-ran Bach proof-point inspection/golden comparison after M10/background updates; mismatch improved to `0.129259` with `ssim=0.290393` (still advisory fail), and planning/risk state was updated to track remaining M10C/M10D fidelity work.
- 2026-02-11: Added paginated-layout integration coverage in `tests/integration/public-api.test.ts` to lock header/title/page-number/label option behavior and multi-page output under deterministic small-page settings.
- 2026-02-11: Fixed paginated spanner diagnostics by making spanner evaluation page-window-aware; off-page anchors no longer trigger false `SPANNER_ANCHOR_NOT_RENDERED` warnings while same-window anchor misses remain actionable.
- 2026-02-11: Added metadata fallback parsing from centered MusicXML `<credit><credit-words>` entries so real-world scores without explicit `<work-title>` still surface titles/page numbers in paginated output; parser fallback/precedence tests were added.
- 2026-02-11: Added parser + renderer support for MusicXML `<print new-system/new-page>` directives and corresponding integration tests for forced system/page break behavior.
- 2026-02-11: Revalidated Bach proof-point after print-break/title/spanner updates; render diagnostics are clean and pagination reflects source breaks, but visual parity remains advisory-fail (`mismatchRatio=0.129628`, `ssim=0.288110`) pending M10D spacing/geometry tuning.
- 2026-02-11: Added deterministic system-window auto-crop support for golden proof-points (`autoCropActual.systems`) via `deriveSystemCropRegion` in notation geometry tooling, switched the Bach proof-point config to use it, and re-ran proof-point validation (`mismatchRatio=0.214865`, `ssim=0.189070`, advisory fail) to establish a more reproducible M10D baseline.
- 2026-02-11: Added parser/model support for MusicXML `measure@width` hints (`sourceWidthTenths`) plus renderer weighted system-column sizing from source hints (median across parts), with new parser/render integration tests; Bach proof-point rerun remains advisory fail (`mismatchRatio=0.214798`, `ssim=0.192180`) but spacing drift improved (`first/median gap ratio 1.173 -> 1.1411`).
- 2026-02-11: Added parser support for defaults `system-layout/system-margins` and applied those margins in paginated content-width planning; Bach proof-point improved again (`mismatchRatio=0.203193`, advisory fail). Golden runner now emits a structural mismatch metric alongside raw mismatch/SSIM for better M10D triage.
- 2026-02-11: Added parser/model coverage for note-level source geometry/stem intent (`sourceDefaultXTenths` + `stemDirection`), mapped explicit MusicXML stem direction into VexFlow note creation, and enabled beam generation with maintained authored stem directions; added deterministic parser + unit + integration regression tests.
- 2026-02-11: Added parser/model support for authored MusicXML beam tokens (`<beam number>begin/continue/end</beam>`) and renderer source-beam grouping preference (level-1 beam groups) before auto-beam fallback; added deterministic regression coverage and revalidated Bach proof-point metrics.
- 2026-02-11: Added optional centroid-based alignment to headless comparison core (`comparePngBuffers` options: `alignByInkCentroid`, `maxAlignmentShift`, `alignmentAxis`, `alignmentInkThreshold`) and unit coverage demonstrating lower mismatch for translated-but-equivalent images.
- 2026-02-11: Wired golden proof-point normalization to alignment controls, added alignment telemetry to golden reports (`alignmentShiftX`, `alignmentShiftY`), and constrained Bach proof-point alignment to horizontal-only registration (`alignmentAxis: "x"`); latest advisory run remains below target (`mismatchRatio=0.201615`, `structuralMismatchRatio=0.638949`, `ssim=0.170150`).
- 2026-02-11: Fixed beaming regression where flags remained visible on beamed notes by preparing beam groups before `voice.draw()` and drawing prepared beams afterward; added deterministic quality/eval coverage (`flagBeamOverlapCount` metrics, conformance summary fields, and expected-pass gate `expectedPassFlagBeamOverlapCount === 0`), then revalidated with `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, targeted regression/conformance suites, and `npm run test:golden -- --proofpoints-only --fixtures=realworld-music21-bach-bwv1-6-8bars` (`flagCount=0`, `flagBeamOverlapCount=0`).
- 2026-02-11: Added adaptive inter-part spacing in `src/vexflow/render.ts` using adjacent-part complexity heuristics (`estimatePartComplexity`, `resolveInterPartGap`) so dense neighboring parts receive larger vertical gaps; added integration coverage in `tests/integration/public-api.test.ts`.
- 2026-02-11: Hardened part-label layout under source system margins by constraining wrap width to the true left-of-notation lane and keeping notation content width intact; existing `respects defaults system margins` and `keeps long part labels inside page bounds` tests remain green.
- 2026-02-11: Improved slur side/anchor routing in `src/vexflow/render-notations.ts` by selecting slur side from explicit placement or endpoint-skew minimization and computing diagnostics with side-aware anchors aligned to curve rendering.
- 2026-02-11: Expanded headless slur-anomaly detection in `src/testkit/notation-geometry.ts` to parse relative cubic path commands (`c`) in addition to absolute (`C`), and updated unit regression coverage.
- 2026-02-11: Added regression assertion for `realworld-music21-bach-bwv1-6` first-measure spacing stability in `tests/integration/render-quality-regressions.test.ts` (first/median spacing ratio guard > 0.85).
- 2026-02-11: Revalidated with `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run test -- tests/unit/notation-geometry.test.ts`, `npm run test -- tests/integration/public-api.test.ts`, `npm run test -- tests/integration/render-quality-regressions.test.ts`, and refreshed proof-point inspections (`proof-bwv1-6-latest`, `proof-op133-latest`, `proof-op18-latest`).
- 2026-02-11: Fixed multi-staff clef regression for real-world fixtures by merging parser clef updates per staff (`applyAttributeUpdate`) instead of replacing full clef arrays, adding source-order fallback for unnumbered multi-clef groups, and preventing renderer cross-staff clef leakage; added parser integration regression coverage for partial-clef updates.
- 2026-02-11: Revalidated fixture set after clef fix with headless inspection: `realworld-music21-schumann-clara-polonaise-op1n1` and `realworld-music21-mozart-k545-exposition` no longer show prior staff-clef swaps; `realworld-music21-bach-bwv1-6` remains beam/flag clean (`flags=0`, `flagBeamOverlaps=0`).
- 2026-02-11: Hardened demo page overflow behavior by forcing `overflow-x: hidden` in generated demo HTML and rebuilding demos.
- 2026-02-11: Added M11 planning doc (`docs/planning/milestone-11.md`) for auto-format/layout optimization, updated planning index/status, moved closed clef risk `R-021` into `todo.completed.md`, and added open bug tracking for unsupported extreme durations (`B-006`).
- 2026-02-11: Rechecked `B-003` proof-point (`realworld-music21-beethoven-op18no1-m1`) after clef fixes; spacing ratio remains `0.6459` with clean intrusion/beam/curve diagnostics, so the item stays OPEN pending spacing-gate calibration or further formatter tuning.
- 2026-02-11: Fixed CI portability regression in VexFlow gap registry checks by replacing machine-specific absolute paths with workspace-relative paths in `fixtures/vexflow/gap-registry.json`, adding workspace-aware path resolution in `src/testkit/vexflow-gap-registry.ts`, and updating gap-check/brief scripts to use `path.resolve(...)` defaults.
- 2026-02-11: Revalidated CI-equivalent gates after portability fix (`tests/integration/vexflow-gap-registry.test.ts`, `npm run vexflow:gaps:check`, `npm run vexflow:gaps:brief`, full `npm run test`, `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`) — all green.
- 2026-02-11: Added per-band spacing triage output to `npm run inspect:score` (min/max band ratio + compressed-band count) to accelerate B-003 investigation; current `realworld-music21-beethoven-op18no1-m1` snapshot reports `compressed(<0.75)=6/8` with min band ratio `0.2753`.
- 2026-02-11: Continued M10D/M8B remediation with density-aware layout tuning in `src/vexflow/render.ts`: expanded dense-column minimum widths, added peak-local dense-rhythm pressure for system wrapping, and strengthened grand-staff intra-part spacing heuristics for center-register/tie-heavy writing.
- 2026-02-11: Retuned demo output geometry in `scripts/build-demos.mjs` (`layout.scale=1.1`, page `980x1400`, tighter page margins, wider site container, centered SVG max-width) to improve browser readability and reduce right-side whitespace.
- 2026-02-11: Extended renderer regression gates in `tests/integration/render-quality-regressions.test.ts` with `lilypond-03a-rhythm-durations` spacing-band checks and a Schumann proof-point anti-catastrophic spacing guard.
- 2026-02-11: Revalidated targeted gates and quality checks: `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run test -- tests/integration/render-quality-regressions.test.ts tests/integration/vexflow-gap-registry.test.ts`, `npm run demos:build`, plus `npm run inspect:score` for `lilypond-03a-rhythm-durations` and `realworld-music21-schumann-clara-polonaise-op1n1`.
- 2026-02-11: Re-ran `B-003` proof-point after dense-layout tuning (`realworld-music21-beethoven-op18no1-m1`): spacing moved from severe compression to partial compression (`compressed bands: 6/8 -> 1/8`, `min band ratio: 0.2753 -> 0.5577`, first/median ratio `~1.0994`), so backlog status advanced from OPEN to MITIGATING.
- 2026-02-11: Reset demo rendering scale to match library default (`0.8`) in `scripts/build-demos.mjs` per user request, then rebuilt demos.
- 2026-02-11: Ran follow-up M10D spacing tuning: added score-level grand-staff pressure to auto-wrap planning, increased intra-staff gap envelope, and blended density with source width hints in system column allocation; validated with `tests/integration/render-quality-regressions.test.ts` and `inspect:score` on Schumann/op18/03a fixtures.
- 2026-02-11: Outcome of follow-up tuning: `lilypond-03a-rhythm-durations` remains clean (`barlineIntrusions=0`, `compressed=0/2`), `realworld-music21-beethoven-op18no1-m1` remains partial compression (`compressed=1/8`, `min ratio ~0.5577`), and `realworld-music21-schumann-clara-polonaise-op1n1` still shows residual compressed bands (`min ratio ~0.671`); no regression in beam/flag or curve anomaly checks.
- 2026-02-12: Continued M8B/M10D remediation and demo-quality execution: parser now aggregates repeated `<notations>` blocks (articulations/ornaments/slurs/tuplets), direction parsing keeps compound direction-type words/metronome payloads, and category-32 rendering now maps broader tokens to VexFlow modifiers (`Articulation`, `Ornament`, `Vibrato`, `Stroke`, `FretHandFinger`, `Tremolo`) with annotation fallbacks for remaining technical symbols.
- 2026-02-12: Added deterministic regression coverage for multi-notation parsing + category-32 modifier attachment (`tests/integration/parser-csm.test.ts`, `tests/unit/render-note-mapper.test.ts`) and revalidated end-to-end with `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, and full `npm run test` (all passing).
- 2026-02-12: Expanded real-world complexity corpus by importing 3 new active conformance fixtures (`realworld-music21-beethoven-op59no2-m1`, `realworld-music21-mozart-k458-m1`, `realworld-music21-bach-bwv244-10`) via `npm run conformance:realworld:import`; active conformance set is now 179 fixtures (174 pass / 5 fail expected outcomes).
- 2026-02-12: Improved demo-site ergonomics: demo render scale set to `0.7`, LilyPond category labels now show `ID + Name`, and SVG trimming now uses notation-first bounds with nearby-text inclusion to reduce oversized blank canvas areas.
- 2026-02-12: Revalidated key proof-points with headless inspection: `03a-rhythm-durations` remains overflow-clean (`barlineIntrusions=0`, spacing min band `0.9676`), `schumann-clara-polonaise-op1n1` improved but still compressed in dense bands (`compressed 2/6`, min band `0.671`), and `32a-notations` now maps most notation symbols but still has high text overlap pressure (`text overlaps=21`) tracked for follow-up.
- 2026-02-12: Refreshed headless visual baselines after notation/layout changes (`npm run test:visual:headless:update`) and revalidated (`npm run test:visual:headless` passes 8/8 fixtures).
- 2026-02-12: Continued M8B quality hardening for LilyPond categories 31/32: deduplicated chord-level articulation/ornament modifiers, added per-note compact routing for technical text/fingerings, and enabled overlap-aware row packing for direction text. Headless inspection improved from `31a overlaps 13 -> 7` and `32a overlaps 21 -> 4`; remaining unsupported symbol is `NON_ARPEGGIATE_UNSUPPORTED`.
- 2026-02-12: Added deterministic regression gates for category-31/32 readability and unsupported-symbol coverage in `tests/integration/render-quality-regressions.test.ts` (thresholds `31a <= 8`, `32a <= 6`), updated VexFlow gap registry with `VF-GAP-002` (non-arpeggiate), and revalidated with `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run test`, `npm run demos:build`, `npm run test:visual:headless`, and `npm run vexflow:gaps:check`.
