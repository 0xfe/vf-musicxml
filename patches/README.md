# Patches Directory

This directory is reserved for `patch-package` patches used for temporary VexFlow (or dependency) workarounds.

Policy:
- Keep patches minimal and scoped to one gap entry.
- Every patch file must be linked from:
  - `/Users/mo/git/musicxml/fixtures/vexflow/gap-registry.json`
- Remove patch files when upstream released versions include the fix.

Current state:
- No active `patch-package` patches are tracked yet.
